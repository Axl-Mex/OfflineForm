A proof of concept demo using HTML5 localStorage as a fallback for offline form submission.

Uses window.navigator.onLine to check for connection. When online, for data is sent to the server. When offline, form data is saved using HTML5 localStorage and queued. When network connection is made again, locally stored data is resent to the server.
